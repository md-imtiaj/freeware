<p>Macrium Reflect is a speedy disk imaging and cloning solution for backing up your system.</p>

<p>The accurate image of your hard disk created by free disk imaging software from Macrium Reflect provides great peace of mind. Should you experience the ugly event of a system breakdown or abort an upgrade, just knowing that a compressed, mountable archive file can be used to restore your hard disk exactly as it was gives you that desirable sense of control. Partial loss, which can possibly be even more catastrophic than complete loss, is restorable from the Macrium Reflect backup in that you can retrieve individual partitions. Even individual folders and files are retrievable - just create a virtual drive from the image in Windows Explorer and copy and paste them.</p>

<h2>Backup &amp; Restore</h2>

<p>Macrium Reflect lets you make incremental and differential backups and create a single backup file of any one folder, or more, on your hard disk using &#39;include&#39; and &#39;exclude&#39; filters. Filtering levels also allow you the option of excluding hidden and system files. Being able to browse the backup as a virtual drive in Windows Explorer makes the process comprehensible and easier to use. Restore individual files or the entire backup to your selected location.</p>

<p>You are provided with several compression levels giving you flexibility in terms of disk space whether you are saving backup files to local or network drives, or to DVDs or USB flash drives. Your backups can be password protected.</p>

<h2>Disk Imaging Advantages</h2>

<p>Macrium Reflect free disk imaging software lets you create a backup file of your entire hard disk or one or more partitions. Subsequent backups can be incremental or differential. This allows you to resize a restored partition or change it to or from a logical partition to a bootable one, etc., or to perform a hard disk upgrade in the knowledge that everything is safely backed up, including the Master Boot Record which is automatically saved with all backups.</p>

<h2>Convenience and Safety</h2>

<p>Your backup can be created while your Windows OS is in use. The point of time represented by the disk image is not impacted by access to the disk while it is being backed up or verified. Backup files can be automatically or individually verified or before you restore them and compression levels can be selected depending on your file and speed requirements. An option to access Macrium Reflect at Startup can be added, and the program also allows you to create a rescue disk on CD, DVD or USB flash drive.</p>

<h2>Scheduling</h2>

<p>Backups can be scheduled daily, weekly or monthly with Macrium Reflect free backup software, as can automatic incremental or differential backups to meet your requirements, and completion is automatic. HTML log reports can be viewed in the built-in browser.</p>

<p>Macrium Reflect free backup, disk imaging and cloning software is fully compatible with Windows operating systems, and is available for personal or business use.</p>
