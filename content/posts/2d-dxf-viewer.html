<p>View DXF files without the need for CAD software.</p>

<p>CAD software is challenging to use and requires a huge amount of system resources. However, when your requirement is only to display the contents of DXF files, a DFX file view will prove a lot more efficient. The&nbsp;2D DXF Viewer&nbsp;is a small, standalone application that has the capacity to provide quality output of any CAD-compatible file. In the event that your system can provide you with GPU accelerated rendering, the 2D DXF Viewer will enable ultra-fast viewing of both single and multiple DFX files.</p>

<h2>Simple, comprehensive graphic user interface</h2>

<p>Launched, the viewing application displays a simple user interface with a tool bar comprised of zooming and panning tools. The mouse wheel also conveniently functions to zoom and pan a displayed file. Toggling of Grid and Anti-aliasing tools is also available from the tool bar. File and View menus are located on the menu bar.</p>

<p>The Application Settings menu under the File tab enables you to set background colors and grid lines as well as the type of Anti-Aliasing you prefer, and to control Zoom Animation. Font folders can also be designated from this menu. The easily operated DXF file viewer enables you to fully examine all details of the displayed file, and to view multiple files with no size limitations.</p>

<p>Providing quick access to viewing CAD files, the 2D DXF Viewer is the most convenient solution for displaying quality output on any system, regardless of whether CAD software is available to you. Free downloads are available for Windows 7-10 32-and 64-bit operating systems.</p>
