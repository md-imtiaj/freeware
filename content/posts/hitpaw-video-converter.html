<p>Downloaded, installed, and launched, the HitPaw Video Converter opens to the very easy to navigate interface - Add Files, Converting, and Converted tabs on the menu bar with the file menu and most used control icons at top right. The Converting tab displays files for conversion and you can view the recently converted files using the Converted tab. Files can be dragged and dropped into the main window.</p>

<p>Locate a media file using the file menu, or just drag the file(s) you want to convert into the window. At the left, the &#39;Settings&#39; and &#39;Convert&#39; buttons are displayed. Select the output format you require using the &#39;Setting&#39; button or the &#39;Output Format&#39; dropdown at the bottom of the screen where you can also select an alternative export location from the Output Path dropdown. When all is set, click the &#39;Convert&#39; button at the bottom right. The new file(s) and file information will be displayed upon completion of the conversion.</p>
