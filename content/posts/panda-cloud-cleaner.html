<p>While it is recommended that you install a local antivirus program on your computer, it is also a good idea to have another one that operates in the cloud. One major benefit of using an online antivirus is the assurance of always receiving the latest protection. One such program is Panda Cloud Cleaner. The free antivirus software remotely checks computers against malicious applications.</p>

<p><strong>Using Panda Cloud Cleaner</strong></p>

<p>Installing the desktop version of Panda Cloud Cleaner was relatively straight forward because all we needed to do was follow the clear on-screen instructions. The antivirus offered to perform a quick scan after installation, which checked the areas most commonly infected by viruses.</p>

<p>We could also perform a full scan to check every part of our computer. In addition, the program allowed us to configure folders we wanted it to scan.</p>

<p>If you want to get maximum protection, then you need an Internet connection, as the antivirus relies heavily on cloud knowledge. However, it also includes a local antivirus engine that makes it possible to detect serious threats even without going online. The program does not offer real time protection.</p>

<p>The quick scan was as quick as its name implied. However, processing some information and returning the results of detection took significant time because it had to connect to the online database.</p>

<p>The program cleverly integrates advanced tools with simplicity of use, which makes it ideal for both novice and advanced users. Some of the things we could do with it included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unlocking files that malware use to enable manual deletion</li>
	<li>Terminating all processes that the system did not need to operate</li>
	<li>Sending suspicious but yet unclassified data to Panda labs</li>
	<li>Performing trusted boot scan to detect rootkits and stop viruses from preventing disinfection</li>
	<li>Ability to delete temporary files that Web browsers usually leave behind</li>
</ul>

<p>The program allowed us to select the files we wanted to delete.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Panda Cloud Cleaner scores high on various antivirus removal tests, and different labs have certified it for the detection and cleaning of antivirus. It is also a user-friendly and free virus protection program that even a novice will not have difficulties handling.</p>

<p>Although it wiped out some files that were not inherently malicious but only infected by viruses, this is a common occurrence among cleaners that operate more aggressively. It is therefore recommended for systems that already have malware problems.</p>
